# Covalent (the Electron app)

Covalent gives you a desktop app wrapper for using Daily's prebuilt call interface, with a few extra superpowers:

- Stream Deck plugin
- A (probably broken right now) transcription viewer
- More recording controls (coming soon)
- Save your default devices across Daily domains (also coming soon)

I use this mostly as a way to have something I can quickly command-tab back to, instead of having to find a buried Chrome tab.

## Getting Started

You probably want to head to the Releases section on the right and download a fully built release so you don't have to mess with Electron tooling.

If you want to customize the app or help me add features, you can clone the repo, `npm install`, and `npm start` to run your own version. Pull requests and bug reports are welcome!
